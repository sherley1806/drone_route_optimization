Drone Route Optimization System (Python Project)

•Project Overview
This project is a Python-based Drone Route Optimization Simulator that determines the most efficient delivery path for a drone visiting multiple locations.
The program accepts:
A starting coordinate
Multiple delivery points
It then calculates the shortest possible route by checking all delivery orders and computing the total travel distance using the Euclidean distance formula.
This simulates the core logic used in real-world autonomous drone navigation and logistics systems.

•Objectives
To simulate how drones optimize delivery routes
To apply mathematical distance formulas in real-world navigation problems
To understand permutation-based search for path optimization
To build problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills using Python

•Technologies Used
Python (Core Programming)
Math module (distance calculation)
Itertools module (permutation logic)
Console-based user interaction

•How the System Works
User enters starting coordinates
User enters number of delivery points
User inputs each delivery location
Program generates all possible delivery routes
Total distance for each route is calculated
The shortest route is selected and displayed

•How to Run the Project
Make sure Python is installed
Download or clone this repository
Open terminal in the project folder
Run the program: python drone_route_optimization.py
Enter coordinates when prompted 
The system will display the optimal route and shortest distance.

python drone_route_optimization.py
Enter coordinates when prompted
The system will display the optimal route and shortest dista
